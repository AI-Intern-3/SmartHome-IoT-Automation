# SmartHome-IoT-Automation
Smart home automation system using Raspberry Pi, IoT sensors, and AWS. Features mobile/web app control, real-time sensor data analysis, cloud storage with AWS RDS, AI predictions, and AWS SNS notifications for a secure, automated home environment.
Let’s walk through the steps of the smart home automation project, starting from hardware selection to cloud deployment.

Step 1: Select the right hardware and sensors for home automation setup

Controller: Raspberry Pi (3B+, 4 or later versions with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity).

Sensors:

PIR motion sensor: For detecting motion in the house.

DHT22 sensor: For monitoring temperature and humidity levels.

Camera module: For capturing images or streaming video.

Relay module: To control devices like lights, fans, or appliances.

Smart switches: For remote on/off control of appliances.


Other components: Jumper wires, resistors, breadboard, power supply.

Internet connectivity: Use built-in Wi-Fi on the Raspberry Pi for internet access.


Step 2: Connect the module to internet with a static IP

Set up Raspberry Pi:

1. Install Raspbian OS on Raspberry Pi.


2. Connect to Wi-Fi or Ethernet for internet connectivity.


3. Assign a static IP to your Raspberry Pi by configuring your router or editing the /etc/dhcpcd.conf file.


4. Enable SSH/VNC for remote access to Raspberry Pi.



Install dependencies: Install required Python libraries like RPi.GPIO, paho-mqtt, Adafruit_DHT, and picamera.

Test the sensors: Write a Python script to test the sensors (DHT22, PIR, Camera) and ensure the Raspberry Pi is correctly reading data from them.


Step 3: Add mobile/web app control with high availability cluster

Web Application:

Develop a React.js web application for monitoring sensor data and controlling home devices via a relay.

Connect the web app to the Raspberry Pi using MQTT protocol to exchange real-time data.


Mobile Application:

Use React Native or Flutter to build a mobile app that connects to the Raspberry Pi via the same MQTT broker.

The app will allow remote control (e.g., turning on/off lights) and display sensor data (temperature, humidity, motion alerts).


High Availability Setup:

Implement clustering using AWS services for scalability and high availability.

For mobile/web applications, use AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in combination with ECS or EKS for high availability.



Step 4: Deploy the application using AWS ECS or EKS

Containerize the applications:

Use Docker to containerize the web and mobile backend applications.

Create a Dockerfile for both services and define service configuration.


Use AWS ECS or EKS:

Set up an ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster.

Deploy the containerized applications (MQTT broker, mobile/web server) to ECS/EKS.

Set up Amazon RDS for a relational database to store application data, with MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database engine.

Use AWS S3 to store large files like video footage from the camera module.



Step 5: Store data locally

Local data storage on Raspberry Pi:

Set up local SQLite or a small MySQL database on Raspberry Pi to store sensor data temporarily.

Store critical logs (e.g., motion detection events, temperature readings).

Ensure that the system syncs this data periodically with AWS RDS to avoid data loss.



Step 6: Connect the module to AWS cloud and store data on RDS DB

AWS IoT Core Integration:

1. Connect Raspberry Pi to AWS IoT Core via MQTT protocol.


2. Create AWS IoT policies and certificates for secure communication.


3. Publish sensor data from the Raspberry Pi to AWS IoT Core topics.



Store data in AWS RDS:

1. Set up an Amazon RDS MySQL/PostgreSQL database to store sensor data.


2. Use Python or Node.js to write a service on Raspberry Pi that forwards sensor data to AWS RDS.


3. Use AWS Lambda or AWS IoT Rule Engine to automatically insert incoming sensor data into the RDS database.



AWS SNS for notifications:

Set up AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send SMS/email alerts for specific events (e.g., motion detected, high temperature).



With these steps, the smart home system will be functional, scalable, and capable of storing data both locally and in the AWS cloud.

Let’s proceed with the next steps for the smart home automation project:

Step 7: Perform Data Analysis on Data Present in RDS DB

1. Connect to RDS database:

Use SQLAlchemy or Psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL) or MySQL Connector (for MySQL) in Python to connect to your AWS RDS database.

Fetch sensor data (e.g., temperature, motion events) stored in the database for analysis.



2. Perform data analysis:

Use Pandas to load the data into a DataFrame for easy manipulation.

Conduct basic analysis such as:

Descriptive statistics: Average temperature, maximum/minimum humidity, frequency of motion detection.

Time-series analysis: Analyze data trends (e.g., temperature variations over time).

Predictive modeling: Train a machine learning model (e.g., regression for temperature prediction) using Scikit-learn.




3. Anomaly detection:

Use AI/ML algorithms like Isolation Forest or K-means clustering to detect anomalies in sensor data (e.g., unusual temperature spikes or frequent motion).




Step 8: Create Graphical Representation of Data using MATLAB and AWS Services

1. Fetch data from RDS:

Use Python or MATLAB's Database Toolbox to retrieve data from the AWS RDS database.



2. MATLAB Visualization:

Use MATLAB Plotting Tools to create visual representations of the data:

Time-series plots for temperature, humidity, and motion sensor data.

Histograms to show the distribution of temperature and humidity over a period.

Scatter plots to visualize motion sensor events and frequency over time.




3. AWS Visualization Services (optional):

If you prefer AWS for visualizations, consider using Amazon QuickSight for generating advanced visualizations (charts, graphs) from your RDS data.



4. Publish Graphs:

Use AWS S3 to store the generated graphs from MATLAB or AWS Lambda to trigger the report generation.

Display the results on your web application for users to see real-time analytics.




Step 9: Generate SMS and Email Notifications using AWS Services

1. Set up AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service):

Create an AWS SNS Topic for sending notifications.

Subscribe endpoints to the SNS topic:

SMS: Add phone numbers.

Email: Add email addresses.




2. Integrate SNS with your system:

In your Python code (on Raspberry Pi or web application), use Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python) to send notifications to AWS SNS.

Trigger notifications based on specific conditions (e.g., motion detected, abnormal temperature levels).


Example:

import boto3
sns_client = boto3.client('sns')
response = sns_client.publish(
    TopicArn='arn:aws:sns:your-region:your-account-id:your-topic',
    Message='Motion detected in your home!',
    Subject='Smart Home Alert',
)


3. Automated notifications:

Set up AWS Lambda functions that will trigger SNS notifications based on IoT data or conditions met in the RDS database (e.g., high temperature, motion detection).

Use AWS CloudWatch Alarms to monitor specific metrics (e.g., CPU usage, IoT data) and trigger SNS alerts.
