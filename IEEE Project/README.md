# SmartHome-IoT-Automation

**Smart home automation system using Raspberry Pi, IoT sensors, and AWS.**  
Features mobile/web app control, real-time sensor data analysis, cloud storage with AWS RDS, AI predictions, and AWS SNS notifications for a secure, automated home environment.

## Steps to Implement Smart Home Automation Project

### Step 1: Select the Right Hardware and Sensors
- **Controller:** Raspberry Pi (3B+, 4 or later with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth).
- **Sensors:**
  - PIR motion sensor (detects motion).
  - DHT22 sensor (monitors temperature and humidity).
  - Camera module (captures images or streams video).
  - Relay module (controls devices like lights, fans).
  - Smart switches (for remote control of appliances).
- **Other Components:** Jumper wires, resistors, breadboard, power supply.
- **Internet Connectivity:** Use built-in Wi-Fi on the Raspberry Pi.

### Step 2: Connect the Module to Internet with a Static IP
- Install Raspbian OS on Raspberry Pi.
- Connect to Wi-Fi/Ethernet and assign a static IP.
- Enable SSH/VNC for remote access.
- Install dependencies (RPi.GPIO, paho-mqtt, Adafruit_DHT, picamera).
- Test sensors with Python scripts.

### Step 3: Add Mobile/Web App Control with High Availability
- **Web Application:** Build with React.js, control devices and monitor sensor data using MQTT protocol.
- **Mobile Application:** Use React Native/Flutter to allow control via MQTT.
- **High Availability:** Set up clustering using AWS ELB with ECS/EKS.

### Step 4: Deploy Application using AWS ECS or EKS
- Containerize the web and mobile backend applications using Docker.
- Deploy containerized applications to ECS/EKS.
- Use AWS RDS for database storage (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
- Store large files (e.g., video footage) on AWS S3.

### Step 5: Store Data Locally on Raspberry Pi
- Use SQLite or a small MySQL database on Raspberry Pi.
- Sync data with AWS RDS periodically to prevent data loss.

### Step 6: Connect Module to AWS Cloud and Store Data in RDS
- Connect Raspberry Pi to AWS IoT Core via MQTT.
- Publish sensor data to AWS IoT Core topics.
- Forward data to AWS RDS using Python or Node.js.
- Set up AWS SNS to send alerts for specific events.

### Step 7: Perform Data Analysis on Data in RDS
- Connect to AWS RDS using SQLAlchemy/Psycopg2 (PostgreSQL) or MySQL Connector.
- Use Pandas to load data for analysis.
- Conduct time-series analysis and anomaly detection using AI/ML models (e.g., Scikit-learn, K-means, Isolation Forest).

### Step 8: Create Graphical Representations using MATLAB/AWS
- Retrieve data from AWS RDS and visualize using MATLAB plotting tools.
- Use MATLAB for time-series plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
- Optionally use AWS QuickSight for advanced visualizations.

### Step 9: Generate SMS and Email Notifications using AWS SNS
- Create an AWS SNS topic and subscribe endpoints (SMS/Email).
- Use Boto3 SDK in Python to send notifications via AWS SNS based on sensor events (motion detected, temperature anomaly).
- Automate notifications using AWS Lambda functions and CloudWatch alarms.

By following these steps, we will build a complete smart home automation system with mobile/web control, real-time data analysis, and cloud-based notifications.
