To analyze current and voltage sensor data for calculating power dissipation and estimating the life of an electric product, you can follow these steps. This process includes collecting data, performing calculations, and visualizing the results graphically using libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn.

Step-by-Step Process

## Step 1: Collect Data from Current and Voltage Sensors

Assuming you have connected current and voltage sensors to your ESP32 and are sending data to AWS IoT Core and DynamoDB, ensure the following:

Current sensor provides real-time current readings (e.g., in Amperes).

Voltage sensor provides real-time voltage readings (e.g., in Volts).

You send these readings to DynamoDB, where they are stored in a table.


## Step 2: Calculate Power Dissipation

Power dissipation in electrical devices can be calculated using the formula:



Where:

 = Power (Watts)

 = Voltage (Volts)

 = Current (Amperes)


You can calculate the power dissipation based on the data collected from the current and voltage sensors.

## Step 3: Estimate the Life of the Electric Product

The life of an electric product can depend on various factors including usage patterns, ambient conditions, and the total energy consumed over time. A simplified model can be:

1. Calculate Total Energy Consumption:

Energy (Wh) = Power (W) Ã— Time (h)



2. Estimate Product Life:

If a product has a rated life (in kWh), you can calculate its life as follows:

Life (in hours) = Rated Life (kWh) / Power Consumption (W)




## Step 4: Retrieve and Analyze Data from DynamoDB

You can use a Python script in an AWS SageMaker Notebook to retrieve data from your DynamoDB table, calculate power dissipation, and estimate the product life.

4.1 Example Code to Retrieve and Calculate Data
```
import boto3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize DynamoDB resource
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

# Specify the table name
table = dynamodb.Table('SensorData')

# Query the DynamoDB table for current and voltage data
response = table.scan()  # You may want to use more specific queries depending on your schema
data = response['Items']

# Convert data to pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert necessary columns to numeric types
df['Voltage'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Voltage'])
df['Current'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Current'])
df['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp'])

# Calculate Power Dissipation (W)
df['Power'] = df['Voltage'] * df['Current']

# Assuming usage time in hours for each reading (e.g., 1 hour between each timestamp)
df['Time'] = 1  # 1 hour for simplicity
df['Energy'] = df['Power'] * df['Time']  # Energy in Wh

# Assume the rated life of the product is in kWh
rated_life_kWh = 1000  # Example value

# Estimate product life in hours
df['Estimated_Life'] = rated_life_kWh * 1000 / df['Power']

# Print the DataFrame to check calculations
print(df[['Timestamp', 'Voltage', 'Current', 'Power', 'Energy', 'Estimated_Life']])
```
## Step 5: Graphical Representation

You can visualize the power dissipation and estimated life of the electric product using Matplotlib.

5.1 Plotting Power Dissipation Over Time
```
# Plot Power Dissipation
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(df['Timestamp'], df['Power'], label='Power Dissipation (W)', color='blue')
plt.title('Power Dissipation Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Timestamp')
plt.ylabel('Power (W)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

5.2 Plotting Estimated Life Over Time

# Plot Estimated Product Life
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(df['Timestamp'], df['Estimated_Life'], label='Estimated Life (hours)', color='green')
plt.title('Estimated Product Life Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Timestamp')
plt.ylabel('Estimated Life (hours)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
## Step 6: Putting It All Together

Run the above code in your SageMaker notebook to pull the sensor data from DynamoDB, calculate power dissipation, and estimate the life of the electric product.

The graphical representations will help visualize how power consumption varies over time and provide insights into the estimated life based on power usage.


Additional Considerations

Threshold Monitoring: Set up alerts using AWS CloudWatch and SNS if power consumption exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential issues.

Data Storage: Store the results and visualizations in an S3 bucket for long-term analysis.

Modeling Improvements: You can refine the models for estimating product life based on more factors, such as ambient temperature and operational cycles.


By following these steps, you can effectively analyze current and voltage data to calculate power dissipation and estimate the life of electric products, providing valuable insights into energy consumption and product reliability.
