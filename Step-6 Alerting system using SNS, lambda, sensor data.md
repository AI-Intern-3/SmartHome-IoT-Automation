To set up message and email notifications based on sensor data stored in AWS DynamoDB and trigger alerts when values go above a threshold, you can follow the steps below. We will use AWS Lambda, AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS), and AWS CloudWatch to monitor the data in DynamoDB and trigger notifications when necessary.

## Step 1: Create an SNS Topic for Notifications

1. Go to AWS SNS Console:

Open the SNS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/.



2. Create a New SNS Topic:

Click Topics → Create topic.

Select Standard topic.

Enter a name for the topic (e.g., SensorAlerts).

Click Create topic.



3. Create Subscriptions:

After the topic is created, go to Subscriptions → Create subscription.

Select Protocol (e.g., Email or SMS).

Enter your email address or phone number in the Endpoint field.

Confirm the subscription by checking your email or phone for the confirmation message.

## Step 2: Set Up a Lambda Function to Check Data from DynamoDB

Next, we’ll create a Lambda function that will periodically query the DynamoDB table where the sensor data is stored, check the values, and send an alert via SNS if any value exceeds a predefined threshold.

1. Go to AWS Lambda Console:

Open the Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.



2. Create a New Lambda Function:

Click Create function.

Choose Author from scratch.

Enter a name for the function (e.g., DynamoDBSensorAlert).

Select Runtime as Python 3.x (or any other preferred language).

Click Create function.



3. Add Permissions to Lambda:

Go to Configuration → Permissions.

Attach the following policies:

AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess – to allow reading data from DynamoDB.

AmazonSNSFullAccess – to send notifications using SNS.




4. Write the Lambda Code to Check Sensor Data from DynamoDB:

In the Lambda function editor, write the code to query the DynamoDB table for sensor data and check if any value exceeds the threshold.




Here is a sample Lambda function in Python that checks sensor data and sends an alert via SNS:
```
import json
import boto3
from boto3.dynamodb.conditions import Key, Attr
import os

# Initialize DynamoDB and SNS clients
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
sns_client = boto3.client('sns')

# Get environment variables
TABLE_NAME = os.environ['DYNAMODB_TABLE']
SNS_TOPIC_ARN = os.environ['SNS_TOPIC_ARN']

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Connect to the DynamoDB table
    table = dynamodb.Table(TABLE_NAME)
    
    # Query or scan the table to get sensor data
    response = table.scan()
    
    alerts = []
    
    # Thresholds (you can define them based on your needs)
    temp_threshold = 50  # Example: temperature threshold
    gas_threshold = 200   # Example: gas sensor threshold
    
    # Process each item in the DynamoDB response
    for item in response['Items']:
        temperature = int(item.get('temperature', 0))
        gas_level = int(item.get('gas', 0))
        
        # Check if temperature exceeds the threshold
        if temperature > temp_threshold:
            alerts.append(f"High Temperature Alert! Current temperature: {temperature}°C")
        
        # Check if gas level exceeds the threshold
        if gas_level > gas_threshold:
            alerts.append(f"High Gas Level Alert! Current gas value: {gas_level}")
    
    # If there are alerts, send them via SNS
    if alerts:
        message = "\n".join(alerts)
        sns_client.publish(
            TopicArn=SNS_TOPIC_ARN,
            Message=message,
            Subject='Device Alert: Sensor Threshold Exceeded'
        )
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps('Alert sent successfully!')
        }
    else:
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps('No alerts triggered.')
        }
```

5. Set Environment Variables for Lambda:

Go to Configuration → Environment Variables and add the following variables:

DYNAMODB_TABLE: Name of your DynamoDB table where sensor data is stored.

SNS_TOPIC_ARN: The ARN of your SNS topic for sending notifications.




6. Test the Lambda Function:

You can manually test the Lambda function by simulating the sensor data to ensure the alerts are triggered properly.

## Step 3: Set Up an Event to Trigger Lambda Periodically

You can use CloudWatch Events to trigger the Lambda function periodically to check the sensor data in DynamoDB.

1. Go to AWS CloudWatch Console:

Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.



2. Create a CloudWatch Event Rule:

Go to Rules → Create rule.

Select Event Source as EventBridge (CloudWatch Events).

In Create a Rule, choose Event Source as Schedule.

Define the schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes, or based on your requirement).



3. Configure the Rule to Trigger Lambda:

In the Targets section, select Lambda function.

Choose your Lambda function (DynamoDBSensorAlert).

Click Create rule.




Now, the Lambda function will run periodically, check the sensor data in DynamoDB, and send alerts via SNS if any value exceeds the defined thresholds.


---

## Step 4: Set Up CloudWatch Alarms (Optional)

You can also configure CloudWatch Alarms to monitor specific metrics from your sensor data and trigger SNS notifications when thresholds are exceeded.

1. Create Custom Metrics (Optional):

If your ESP32 is publishing data directly to AWS IoT Core, you can also configure IoT Rules to send sensor data as CloudWatch metrics.

Use these custom metrics to set alarms in CloudWatch.



2. Go to CloudWatch Console:

Open the CloudWatch console → Alarms → Create Alarm.



3. Select the Metric:

Choose the relevant sensor metric (either custom or device-specific).



4. Set the Alarm Threshold:

Define the threshold for triggering the alarm (e.g., if temperature exceeds 50°C).



5. Configure Notification Actions:

Set the alarm action to notify via the SNS topic created earlier.




This allows CloudWatch to automatically send notifications when a certain metric exceeds a specified threshold.

Summary of Steps

1. Set Up SNS Topic for notifications (SMS/Email).


2. Create a Lambda Function that queries sensor data from DynamoDB, checks for threshold violations, and triggers SNS notifications.


3. Set Up CloudWatch Events to run the Lambda function periodically to check for alerts.


4. (Optional) Configure CloudWatch Alarms for direct metric monitoring and automatic notifications.



This setup will allow you to monitor your sensor data, receive notifications for abnormal sensor values, and ensure the health and status of your devices are being tracked.
