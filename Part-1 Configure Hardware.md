For your home automation project, here are four main sensors that will provide essential data for monitoring and automation:

Selected Sensors

1. DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor)

Description: Measures ambient temperature and humidity levels.

Features:

Temperature range: -40 to 125Â°C

Humidity range: 0% to 100% RH

High accuracy and reliability.


Usage: Useful for monitoring indoor climate conditions and automating HVAC systems.



2. HC-SR501 (PIR Motion Sensor)

Description: Detects motion using passive infrared (PIR) technology.

Features:

Senses motion up to 7 meters.

Adjustable sensitivity and time delay.


Usage: Can be used for security systems or to automatically turn on lights when someone enters a room.



3. MQ-2 (Gas Sensor)

Description: Detects various gases such as LPG, smoke, and methane.

Features:

Analog output for gas concentration levels.

Requires calibration for accurate readings.


Usage: Ideal for smoke detection or monitoring gas leaks, providing safety alerts in your home.



4. ESP32-CAM (Camera Module)

Description: An ESP32 board with an integrated camera, allowing for video streaming and image capture.

Features:

Supports Wi-Fi for remote access.

Can be used for motion detection and surveillance.

Capable of capturing images and streaming video.


Usage: Provides visual monitoring of your home, allowing for remote surveillance and security notifications.




Summary of Applications

DHT22 will monitor temperature and humidity levels to ensure a comfortable living environment.

HC-SR501 will enhance security by detecting motion, allowing for automation of lighting and alerts.

MQ-2 will monitor air quality and safety by detecting gases and smoke.

ESP32-CAM will provide visual monitoring through a camera, enabling surveillance and remote access.


These four sensors will form a comprehensive data collection system for your home automation project, allowing you to monitor environmental conditions, detect movement, ensure safety, and provide visual surveillance.
